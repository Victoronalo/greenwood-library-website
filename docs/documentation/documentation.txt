Git Capstone Project Description
A part of the team tasked to enhance the website of Greenwood Community Library and to make it more informative and engaging we adding Book Review and update the Event page.

-First of all, I created a repository with a readme.md file on github
-I created a folder named new-project with command (mkdir new project)
-I created the main branch by using (cd greenwood-library-website)
-created the below files home.html, about-us.html, contact-us.html ,  and event.html using (touch <file>)
-I change the branch by using (git checkout -b add-book-review)
-I created a file book-review.html using (touch book-review.html)
-I included a comment using (# this is morgans work)
-I did git add using (git add book-review.html)
-Did git commit using (git commit -m "morgan work")
-Did git push using (git push origin add-book-review)
-went ahead to do branch change using (git checkout -b update-event)
-Created a file using the command (touch update-event.html)
-Added comment using (# jamie work)
-Did git status to get the status of the file.
-I added to git using (git add update-event.html)
-Did git commit using the command (git commit -m "Update event") to commit changes.
-Then git push using (git push origin update-event).this is to push changes to the remote repository.
-Due to the fact that the repository has three branches a git pull has to be done on git hub this is to create a merge of information within the three branches in the repository.
-I clicked on the branch drop down menu, in the menu is main branch, add-book-review branch and update-event branch. 
-I clicked update-navigation.
-I reviewed the changes to make sure everything is good.  
-I created a pull requested
-The request was merged to incorporate the changes.
